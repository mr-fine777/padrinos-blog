    <h1>Privacy Policy for AdPass</h1>
	<p>Last Updated: 05/25/2025
1. Information Collection

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data. No cookies, IP addresses, browsing history, or personally identifiable information are accessed or recorded.
2. Permissions Use

The extension requests the following permissions:

    activeTab: Used to interact with the current tab to control video playback speed.

    scripting: Used to inject JavaScript into pages to detect and manipulate video and ad elements.

    Host permissions (e.g., *://*/*): Used only to access and modify ad iframe content and playback speed on relevant sites.

These permissions are used solely to provide the intended functionality of the extension and not for any tracking, profiling, or data collection purposes.
3. Ad Replacement & External Scripts

The extension replaces certain 3rd-party ad iframes (e.g., banners and skyscrapers) with alternative ad content. This is done by injecting JavaScript into the web page’s DOM, which loads a remote script from a third-party ad provider (e.g., highperformanceformat.com).

These scripts are loaded into the page context (not the extension), and AdPass does not control their content beyond the initial injection and does not collect or receive any data from them.

You are encouraged to review the third-party ad provider’s privacy policy for more details on how they handle user data.
4. Data Sharing

No data is shared with any third parties by this extension.
5. Security

All functionality is limited to the user’s local browser session. The extension does not communicate with any external servers for processing or data logging.
6. Changes to This Policy

If this policy is updated, users will be notified through the extension’s listing page.
7. Contact
